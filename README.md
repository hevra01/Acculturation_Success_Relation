# Acculturation_Success_Relation

Aim of the project:
This ML model was aimed to find a pattern between different types of Acculturation and both the emotional and career wise success of an individual.

Preparation of the data:
This was my first Machine Learning Project. I wanted to collect my own data through a survey made up of questions that I came up with. There were 65 respondents.
This was planned to be a clustering unsupervised learning because there were no labels and the aim was to find a pattern. 

My assumption about the clustering of the data: Note: Accultration is divided into assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization.
    1) The assimilated people can be more successful career wise since they have been adapted very well to the society. However, emotionally they might be less satisfied because          they have been separeted from their roots and origins.
    2) The integrated people can be more successfull emotionally and career wise. 
    3) Separated people would probably not be very successful career wise since they had been separating themselves from the society and didn't have the chance to interact.

Outcome of the project:
This project wasn't completed successfully due to several reasons:
    1) Firstly, the data was very limited; there weren't enough respondents. 
    2) Second, the assumptions I made were very idealized; whereas in reality, data is much more noisy. 
    3) Furthermore, since this project was sociological oriented and I am not a professional in this field, the survey that I have created most likely wasn't able to test the            relation between acculturation and people's career/emotional life.
