# Acculturation_Success_Relation
This ML model was aimed to find a pattern between different types of Acculturation and both the emotional and career wise success of an individual.

This was my first Machine Learning Project as a beginner. I wanted to collect my own data through a survey made up of questions that I came up with. There were 65 respondents.
This was planned to be a clustering unsupervised learning because there were no labels and the aim was to find a pattern. 

My assumption about the clustering of the data: Note: Accultration is divided into assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization.
  1) The assimilated people can be more successful career wise since they have been adapted very well to the society. However, emotionally they might be less satisfied because          they have been separeted from their roots and origins.
  2) The integrated people can be more successfull emotionally and career wise.
